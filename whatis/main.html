			<h1> Explanation </h1>
			
			<p> The purpose of these documents is to provide an explanation of various mathematical concepts as a resource to students. If you find any of these explanations useful or find any errors, please let me know. I attempt to explain each concept fully, starting from the basics. Additionally, I point to several references that could be used for further reading. </p>
